This program reads in file base_exp.txt and uses parallel processing to find largest exponential number.
Compile with Mpi3-2.
Run with mpiexec -n "desired nodess" ./main base_exp.txt

Currently the program could be improved by implementing the Big Int library to calculate the full size of the calculated integer.
The code does, however, use the desired number of nodes and split the 1000 lines into smaller portions to calculate the max int faster.
